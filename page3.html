            <p>Five years ago, Geeta lost her no-good husband. As in, she actually lost him—he walked out on her and she has no idea where he is. But in her remote village in India, rumor has it that Geeta killed him. And it's a rumor that just won't die. It turns out that being known as a "self-made" widow comes with some perks. Freedom must look good on Geeta, because now other women are asking for her "expertise," making her an unwitting consultant for husband disposal. And not all of them are asking nicely.</p>

                <p>“The serious and

                    domestic violence and caste discrimination
                    give the novel its backbone, but it’s Shroff’s sharp humor,
                    in the form of witty dialogue between the women, that makes
                    this book memorable. ”</p>

                <p>“As the book progresses, might Geeta be able to find her place
                   within her community of women? Might she realize that she has 
                   been extremely bad at reading social cues and has suffered as a result? Perhaps, but Shroff’s narrative was never quite successful in engaging this reader enough to really care about the outcome. ”</p>
